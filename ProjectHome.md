Evolve is an admin mod in development for the Half Life 2 modification Garry's Mod. It will include nearly every useful function found in other well known and widely used admin mods, including ULX and ASSMod. With a sleek and easy to use user interface and its feature richness it is to become "everything a server owner will ever need".

This Mod is for the AGC-Server only!
